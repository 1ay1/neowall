# Staticwall

**Sets wallpapers until it... doesn't.**

A lightweight, reliable Wayland wallpaper daemon written in C. Perfect for tiling window managers and minimal setups. (Mostly reliable. See tagline.)

> **Why "Staticwall" if it cycles wallpapers?** Because it's *static*ally compiled C code that sets wallpapers. The fact that it can also change them dynamically is just a happy accident. We're committed to the bit.

## Features

- üé® **Multiple Display Modes**: center, fill, fit, stretch, tile
- üîÑ **Automatic Cycling**: Rotate through wallpapers on a timer
- üñ•Ô∏è **Multi-Monitor Support**: Configure each monitor independently
- ‚ö° **Hardware Accelerated**: OpenGL ES rendering via EGL
- üî• **Hot Reload**: Update configuration without restarting (`SIGHUP`)
- üé¨ **Smooth Transitions**: Fade and slide effects between wallpapers
- üìÅ **Directory Support**: Point to a folder and cycle through all images
- ü™∂ **Minimal Dependencies**: Pure C with no heavy frameworks (because who needs bloated libraries when you have raw pointers and existential dread?)
- üíÄ **Memory Safety**: We free our allocations. Most of the time. Okay, all of the time, but the joke was funnier before we fixed the bugs.
- üîß **VIBE Config Format**: Simple, human-readable configuration

## Why Staticwall?

Because you have wallpapers and we have... strong opinions on how to display them. Also, we were bored on a Tuesday.

Built as a reliable replacement for `wpaperd` and similar tools, Staticwall focuses on:
- **Stability**: Robust error handling and clean resource management (sets wallpapers until it doesn't crash‚Äîwhich is hopefully never, but we're realistic about our place in the universe)
- **Performance**: Direct Wayland protocol usage with minimal overhead (your CPU has better things to worry about)
- **Simplicity**: Easy configuration with sensible defaults (we assume you want your wallpaper visible, which is a pretty bold assumption)
- **Compatibility**: Works with any wlroots-based compositor (Sway, Hyprland, River, etc.)
- **Name Irony**: Yes, we know it cycles wallpapers dynamically. The name stays. It's static in spirit, dynamic in practice, and confusing in marketing.

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Arch Linux
```bash
# Using yay or your preferred AUR helper
yay -S staticwall-git
```

#### Build from Source
```bash
# Install dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install build-essential libwayland-dev libegl-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev

# Install dependencies (Arch Linux)
sudo pacman -S base-devel wayland wayland-protocols egl-wayland mesa libpng libjpeg-turbo

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/1ay1/staticwall.git
cd staticwall
make
sudo make install
```

**Note:** Staticwall runs as a normal user and doesn't require root privileges to run! Only the binary installation requires sudo. On first run, config and default wallpaper will be automatically copied to your user directories. (We promise not to do anything weird with your home folder. We're just here to set wallpapers, not start a revolution.)

### Usage

On first run, Staticwall will automatically:
- Create config at `~/.config/staticwall/config.vibe`
- Copy default wallpaper to `~/.local/share/staticwall/default.png`

No root/sudo needed to run!

```bash
# Run in foreground (see logs)
staticwall

# Run in background (daemon mode)
staticwall -d

# Run with verbose logging
staticwall -v

# Use custom config
staticwall -c /path/to/config.vibe

# Watch config for changes
staticwall --watch
```

### Configuration

Edit `~/.config/staticwall/config.vibe`:

```vibe
# Simple single wallpaper for all monitors
default {
  path ~/Pictures/wallpaper.png
  mode fill
}

# Cycle through a directory of wallpapers
default {
  path ~/Pictures/wallpapers/
  duration 300  # Change every 5 minutes
  transition fade
}

# Configure specific monitor
output {
  HDMI-A-1 {
    path ~/Pictures/monitor1/
    mode fill
    duration 600
    transition fade
  }
  
  DP-1 {
    path ~/Pictures/monitor2.jpg
    mode center
  }
}
```

#### Display Modes

- **fill** - Scale to fill screen, crop if needed (recommended)
- **fit** - Scale to fit inside screen, may have black bars
- **center** - Center image without scaling
- **stretch** - Stretch to fill screen, may distort
- **tile** - Tile the image

#### Transitions

- **none** - Instant change
- **fade** - Smooth fade between images
- **slide_left** - Slide from right to left
- **slide_right** - Slide from left to right

## Dependencies

### Required
- Wayland client library (because we're not savages living in X11)
- EGL (OpenGL ES interface)
- GLESv2 (OpenGL ES 2.0)
- pthread (for that sweet, sweet concurrency)

### Optional (for image loading)
- libpng (PNG support‚Äîrecommended unless you enjoy staring at error messages)
- libjpeg (JPEG support‚Äîbecause your phone camera outputs these, apparently)

## Supported Compositors

Staticwall works with any Wayland compositor that implements `wlr-layer-shell`:

- ‚úÖ Sway
- ‚úÖ Hyprland
- ‚úÖ River
- ‚úÖ Wayfire
- ‚úÖ Newm
- ‚úÖ Other wlroots-based compositors

## Commands

```bash
staticwall [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
  -c, --config PATH    Specify config file path
  -d, --daemon         Run in background
  -f, --foreground     Run in foreground (default)
  -w, --watch          Watch config file for changes
  -v, --verbose        Enable verbose logging
  -h, --help           Show help message
  -V, --version        Show version information
```

### Signals

- `SIGHUP` - Reload configuration
- `SIGTERM/SIGINT` - Graceful shutdown

```bash
# Reload config
killall -HUP staticwall

# Stop daemon
killall staticwall
```

## Troubleshooting

### Wallpaper not showing
1. Check compositor supports `wlr-layer-shell`
2. Verify image path exists: `ls -la ~/Pictures/wallpaper.png`
3. Run with `-v` flag to see detailed logs
4. Check permissions on image files

### Cycling not working
1. Ensure `duration` is set in config
2. Verify directory contains supported images (PNG, JPEG)
3. Check logs for cycling messages with `-v` flag

### Config not loading
1. Verify config syntax (no quotes on values)
2. Check file permissions
3. Run `staticwall -v` to see config parsing errors

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Debug build with symbols (for when things inevitably go wrong)
make debug

# Clean rebuild (the "have you tried turning it off and on again" of compilation)
make clean && make

# Run tests (we have tests! They even pass sometimes!)
make test
```

## FAQ

### Why is it called "Staticwall" if it changes wallpapers dynamically?

Because it's written in statically compiled C code. The fact that your wallpaper cycles is merely a dynamic side effect of our static determinism. We're committed to the name, even if it doesn't make sense anymore.

Also, "Dynamicwall" was taken and "Sometimesstaticwall" didn't have the same ring to it.

### Does it really set wallpapers until it doesn't?

Yes. It sets wallpapers reliably until something goes wrong (like you unplugging all your monitors, or the heat death of the universe). We're being honest about our limitations.

### Why another wallpaper daemon?

Because the existing ones didn't crash the way we wanted them to. Just kidding ‚Äì we actually focused on *not* crashing, which turned out to be surprisingly effective. Turns out proper error handling is better than artistic segfaults. Who knew?

### Is this production-ready?

It sets wallpapers. On Wayland. Until it doesn't. You decide what "production-ready" means to you. We've been using it for months without issues, but then again, we wrote it, so we know exactly which buttons not to press.

### Will this eat my RAM?

Only a little bit. Like, a polite amount. Your browser tabs are doing far worse things behind your back.

### Can I trust C code written by someone with this sense of humor?

Bold of you to assume correlation between humor quality and code quality. But yes, we take the actual code seriously. The jokes are just coping mechanisms.
