# Staticwall

> "Sets wallpapers until it... doesn't."

A blazingly fast Wayland wallpaper daemon that's **statically** compiled but **dynamically** cycles wallpapers. We contain multitudes. üé≠

![Demo](docs/demo.gif)
*Coming soon: Actual proof this works*

## Why "Staticwall" if wallpapers can be animated?

Great question! The name is a triple pun:
1. **Static linking** - We're compiled into a single binary (no dependency hell!)
2. **Static wallpapers** - Started as a simple image wallpaper setter
3. **Static electricity** - Now we're so dynamic we might shock you ‚ö°

Think of it as ironic branding. Like calling a racecar "SlowPoke" or a giant "Tiny." Plus, "DynamicLiveAnimatedShaderWallpaperDaemon" wouldn't fit in a terminal. ü§∑

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è **Static Images** - PNG, JPEG, the classics
- ‚ú® **Live Shaders** - GPU-accelerated GLSL shaders (Shadertoy compatible!)
- üîÑ **Auto Cycling** - Point at a folder, we'll cycle through it (alphabetically, because we're civilized)
- üé® **Transitions** - Fade, slide, glitch, pixelate (because why not?)
- üñ•Ô∏è **Multi-Monitor** - Different wallpaper per screen
- üî• **Hot-Reload** - Edit config, see changes instantly
- ‚ö° **Hyprland Ready** - Works beautifully on Hyprland (and other wlroots compositors)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (Arch)
yay -S staticwall-git

# Or build from source
make
sudo make install

# Run (creates default config on first run)
staticwall

# Edit your config
$EDITOR ~/.config/staticwall/config.vibe

# Changes apply automatically! No restart needed.
```

## Configuration

Staticwall uses **VIBE** config format. No quotes needed, just vibes. ‚úåÔ∏è

> Look, I know VIBE isn't perfect. It probably has bugs. It's not battle-tested across a billion production servers. But here's the thing: I **really** didn't want colons (`:`) and quotes (`""`) cluttering my config. And I wanted to **see the hierarchy visually** without counting indentation levels or hunting for closing brackets.

> This is for setting wallpapers, not deploying microservices. You point it at a picture. Maybe a folder of pictures. Sometimes a shader if you're feeling spicy.
>
> VIBE is an **axiom** here. Like "water is wet" or "tabs > spaces" (fight me). You literally just write:
>
> ```vibe
> default {
>   path ~/Pictures/cool-mountain.jpg
>   mode fill
> }
> 
> output {
>   HDMI-A-1 {
>     shader plasma.glsl
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> See? The braces show you the structure at a glance. No quotes, no colons, no syntax noise. Just pure hierarchy.
>
> Is it perfect? No. Will it parse your edge cases? Maybe not. But it parses wallpaper configs beautifully, and that's all we need here.
>
> If you want YAML, go configure Ansible. If you want JSON, go configure literally anything else. Here, we vibe. üåä‚ú®

### Static Image Wallpaper

```vibe
default {
  path ~/Pictures/wallpaper.png
  mode fill
}
```

### Cycle Through Images

```vibe
default {
  path ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/    # Trailing slash = directory mode
  duration 300                    # Change every 5 minutes
  mode fill
  transition fade                 # Smooth transitions
}
```

### Live Shader Wallpaper üî•

```vibe
default {
  shader aurora.glsl              # Just the filename!
  shader_speed 1.0                # Animation speed (0.5 = slower, 2.0 = faster)
}
```

Shaders are installed to `~/.config/staticwall/shaders/` on first run. Includes:
- `aurora.glsl` - Northern lights effect
- `matrix_rain.glsl` - The Matrix green code
- `plasma.glsl` - Colorful plasma waves
- And many more!

### Multi-Monitor Setup

```vibe
# Laptop screen gets a shader
output {
  eDP-1 {
    shader plasma.glsl
  }
  
  # External monitor cycles through photos
  HDMI-A-1 {
    path ~/Pictures/Nature/
    duration 600
    transition fade
  }
}
```

Find your monitor names:
- **Sway**: `swaymsg -t get_outputs`
- **Hyprland**: `hyprctl monitors`
- **Generic**: `wlr-randr`

### Cycle Through Shaders

```vibe
default {
  shader ~/.config/staticwall/shaders/    # Point at directory
  duration 300                             # Change shader every 5 minutes
}
```

All shaders in the directory cycle alphabetically. Name them `01-aurora.glsl`, `02-plasma.glsl`, etc. for control.

## Display Modes

- `fill` - Scale to fill screen (crop if needed) **‚Üê recommended**
- `fit` - Scale to fit inside screen (may show borders)
- `center` - No scaling, just center it
- `stretch` - Fill screen (may distort aspect ratio)
- `tile` - Repeat image to fill screen

## Transitions

Available effects:
- `fade` - Smooth crossfade (default)
- `slide_left` - Slide old image left
- `slide_right` - Slide old image right  
- `glitch` - Digital corruption effect
- `pixelate` - Mosaic block transition
- `none` - Instant switch (boring!)

## Commands

```bash
staticwall              # Start daemon
staticwall kill         # Stop daemon
staticwall reload       # Reload config
staticwall next         # Skip to next wallpaper/shader
staticwall pause        # Pause cycling
staticwall resume       # Resume cycling
staticwall current      # Show current wallpaper
```

## Writing Custom Shaders

Shaders use GLSL and get these uniforms automatically:

```glsl
#version 100
precision highp float;

uniform float time;        // Elapsed seconds
uniform vec2 resolution;   // Screen size

void main() {
    vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution.xy;
    vec3 color = vec3(uv, sin(time));
    gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}
```

Save as `~/.config/staticwall/shaders/myshader.glsl` and use:

```vibe
default {
  shader myshader.glsl
}
```

**Shadertoy Compatible!** Most Shadertoy shaders work with minimal changes. We provide `iTime`, `iResolution`, `iChannel0-4` uniforms.

## Why Staticwall?

- **No dependencies** - Single binary, statically linked (except system libs)
- **Actually works** - Tested on Hyprland, Sway, River
- **Fast** - Shaders run at 60 FPS with minimal CPU usage
- **Simple** - One config file, sensible defaults
- **Funny name** - Worth it for the puns alone

## Troubleshooting

**Shader shows black screen?**
- Check logs: `staticwall -fv` (foreground + verbose)
- Shaders compile on load, may take a second
- Complex shaders may need optimization

**Config changes don't apply?**
- Hot-reload is enabled by default, just wait 2 seconds
- Force reload: `staticwall reload`

**Wallpaper not visible?**
- Make sure no other wallpaper daemon is running (swaybg, hyprpaper, etc.)
- Check if it's in Hyprland layers: `hyprctl layers`

## Building from Source
