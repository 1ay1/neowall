## Answer to Your Question: "How can I use eglinfo -B to make everything easier?"

### TL;DR

```bash
# Quick check your system capabilities
eglinfo -B 2>/dev/null | grep -A 10 "Wayland"

# Or use our helper script
./scripts/egl-check.sh
```

---

## What We Added for eglinfo Integration

### 1. Helper Scripts

**`scripts/egl-check.sh`** - Quick capability check
```bash
./scripts/egl-check.sh
# Shows: EGL version, GL ES version, vendor
```

**`scripts/check-egl-capabilities.sh`** - Full analysis  
```bash
./scripts/check-egl-capabilities.sh
# Shows: All GL versions, extensions, Staticwall compatibility
```

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation

**`docs/USING_EGLINFO.md`** - Complete guide covering:
- Quick reference commands
- Build-time vs runtime detection
- Troubleshooting
- CI/CD integration
- Pre-commit hooks

## How It Makes Development Easier

### Before Building
```bash
# Check if your system can build Staticwall
eglinfo -B 2>/dev/null | grep "Wayland" -A 10 | grep "OpenGL ES"
```

### During Development
```bash
# Compare build detection vs actual capabilities
make print-caps                # What we're building against
eglinfo -B | grep "OpenGL ES"  # What system actually has
```

### After Building
```bash
# Verify runtime matches expectations
./build/bin/staticwall -f -v 2>&1 | grep "OpenGL ES"  # What we're using
```

### On Different Systems
```bash
# Test on remote machine
ssh user@machine "eglinfo -B 2>/dev/null | grep 'Wayland' -A 10"
```

Or with updated message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Multi-version EGL/OpenGL ES support with eglinfo integration

Major Features:
- Multi-version EGL/GL ES support (ES 2.0 â†’ 3.2) with auto-detection
- Shader adaptation layer for cross-version compatibility
- Fixed all runtime crashes (SIGSEGV)
- Enhanced Shadertoy support with dynamic GLSL versioning

Developer Tools:
- eglinfo integration scripts for capability checking
- Comprehensive documentation (6 guides)
- Helper scripts for pre-build validation

Testing:
- âœ… Compiles without errors
- âœ… Runs stable on NVIDIA RTX 4060 / OpenGL ES 3.2
- âœ… Automatic fallback tested

Version: 0.2.0-dev"
```

## Key Benefits of eglinfo Integration

1. **Pre-build validation** - Know if your system can build before trying
2. **Debug build issues** - Compare pkg-config vs actual GPU
3. **Test deployment targets** - Check remote systems before deploying
4. **CI/CD integration** - Automated capability checking
5. **Developer experience** - Quick commands for common tasks
